# Next Build Stats

Track and analyze Next.js page sizes, per-page rendering type and build performance with automated PR comments.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Automatically generates per-route build statistics
- Creates informative PR comments with performance metrics
- Helps track build time and dependency installation time
- Supports both App Router and Pages Router
- Compatible with latest Next.js versions

## üìã Quick Start Guide

This GitHub Action runs on workflows triggered by **pull_request** events.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure your workflow has `pull-requests: write` permission to create comments.

### Installation Steps

1. **Capture Build Logs**
  Save your Next.js build logs to a file by modifying your build command:
  ```bash
  npm run build | tee build.log
  ```

  You can also measure the build time, which will automatically be included in the output:
  ```bash
  command time -p npm run build 2>&1 | tee build.log
  ```

  **Important:** Error redirection (`2>&1`) should be used to capture the measured time.

2. **Add to Workflow**
   Include this action after your build step:
   ```yaml
   - uses: aramikuto/next-build-stats@main
     with:
       build-log-file: 'build.log'
   ```

Once configured, you'll see detailed build statistics in your PR comments:
